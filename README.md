D3Backend
====

This is (or will be) the backend server used by us (Double Door Development) to control our Minecraft servers.

Please also look at the TODO list.

**WARNING: 100% INSECURE! THERE IS NO SAFEGUARDS AT ALL**<br>
**We are not responsible for lost worlds, hacked accounts or destroyed servers.**

How?
----

This backend is a java program with build in HTTP server, you can change the port/ip (and other settings) in a JSON based config.
Everything else should be (or will be) configurable trough the web interface.
